# Project: Gallery of My Life

A slice of my simple life.

## Description

This project is to display a sample gallery of things in my life. Each photo will have a description, which is revealed on click. Each photo will also have a 'like' button which will increment a counter on click. By completing this project I'm practicing the use of React.js, inline Arrow functions, .map for loops, GET route, PUT route, and conditional rendering.

### Task List

[] Break project down into smaller pieces
    - commit with each step
    - keep steps to where you can see updates
[X] Add images to public gallery
    [X] Update gallery.data.js with path for each image
[X] Create axios GET route in App.jsx to pull data from gallery to use on the DOM
[X] Create destructured variable for GalleryArray
[] Create a variable for specific GalleryItem  
    [] Create a function for GalleryItem to toggle between the photo and description onClick, using conditional rendering
    [] Use PUT and GalleryItem to like a photo, incrementing like-count
[] Update the like count each time a like button is clicked
